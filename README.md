# Portfolio
I am a Java Backend Developer (Fresher) with a strong foundation in Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming, JDBC, JSP, Servlets, and Hibernate.

I have hands-on experience in building real-world applications such as a Job Portal System, Employee Management System, and an ATM Simulator, where I focused on backend logic, database integration, and clean code practices.

Coming from a Robotics & AI academic background, I bring strong problem-solving skills and a structured approach to software development. I am passionate about learning modern backend technologies, writing maintainable code, and building scalable applications.

Currently, I am seeking entry-level Java developer roles or internships where I can contribute, grow, and gain industry-level experience.
